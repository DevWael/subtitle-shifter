00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hello, welcome to the movie.

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:08,200
This is a sample subtitle file
for testing purposes.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,500
The timing should be
perfectly synchronized.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Now let's test the subtitle shifter!

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,500
If you shift by +1000ms,
this should become 00:00:21,000.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
And this one should become 00:00:26,000.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Testing partial shift:
This is in the middle range.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Still in the partial range
if set correctly.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Outside the partial range now.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The end of our test file.
Thank you for testing!
